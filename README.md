# Youtube_Clone
A YouTube video player page in order to understand the basics of HTML and CSS.

In this little project I tried to replicate a YouTube video page. I built this page uing HTML/CSS solely. It helped me to get a good grasp on the basics of HTML/CSS. This project was built in order to revise the basic conceps of HTML, CSS, GitHub for my MIcroverse journey ahead.
